# musicplayer

Not really finished but i use it

so i might as well release it via github

## uses fmod

i made this because i wanted a music player that had pitching and shit

the code is a bit shit when it comes to certain parts e.g. making sure it doesn't skip ahead in playlist when playing a song and shit

sorry

controls:

- space = play song
- Up/Down = choose from songs
- Left/Right = change selected pitch/speed
- holding shift = pick a specfic pitch/speed
- W/S = choosing between ptich/speed
- 1 = Playlist
- 2 = toggle single loop
- 3 = toggle drawing ofr the Fps
- the media buttons on certain keyboards = Obvious

i may work on this more aka add tagging and better ui

also btw looping is a bit funky with midis that have desynced pitching and speeds, too lazy to fix whilst making it sound good

fmod please fix this<br>
<br>

if i do add tagging the library i will use is: [atldotnet](https://github.com/Zeugma440/atldotnet)

made in gamemaker cuz errr
